class TriaxialEllipsoid:
    """
    Triaxial ellipsoid with arbitrary orientation.

    Define a triaxial ellipsoid whose semi-axes lengths are ``a > b > c``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b, c : floats
        Semi-axis lengths of the ellipsoid. Must satisfy the condition: ``a > b > c``.
    yaw : float
        Rotation angle about the upward axis, in degrees.
    pitch : float
        Rotation angle about the northing axis (after yaw rotation), in degrees.
        A positive pitch angle _lifts_ the side of the ellipsoid pointing in easting
        direction.
    roll : float
        Rotation angle about the easting axis (after yaw and pitch rotation), in
        degrees.
    centre : tuple of floats
        Coordinates of the center of the ellipsoid in the following order: _easting_,
        _northing_, _upward_.

    Notes
    -----
    The three semi-axes ``a``, ``b``, and ``c`` are defined parallel to the ``easting``,
    ``northing`` and ``upward`` directions, respectively, before applying any rotation.

    Rotations directed by ``yaw`` and ``roll`` are applied using the right-hand rule
    across their respective axes. Pitch rotations are carried out in the opposite
    direction, so a positive ``pitch`` _lifts_ the side of the ellipsoid pointing in the
    easting direction.

class ProlateEllipsoid:
    """
    Prolate ellipsoid with arbitrary orientation.

    Define a prolate ellipsoid whose semi-axes lengths are ``a > b = c``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : floats
        Semi-axis lengths of the ellipsoid. Must satisfy the condition: ``a > b = c``.
    yaw : float
        Rotation angle about the upward axis, in degrees.
    pitch : float
        Rotation angle about the northing axis (after yaw rotation), in degrees.
        A positive pitch angle _lifts_ the side of the ellipsoid pointing in easting
        direction.
    centre : tuple of floats
        Coordinates of the center of the ellipsoid in the following order: _easting_,
        _northing_, _upward_.

    Properties
    ----------
    c : float
        Equal to ``b`` by definition.
    roll : float
        Set always equal to zero. Roll rotations have no effect on ``ProlateEllipsoid``s
        due to symmetry.

    Roll rotations are not enabled in the prolate ellipsoid, since they don't have any
    effect due to symmetry. Hence, ``roll`` is always equal to zero for the
    ``ProlateEllipsoid``.
