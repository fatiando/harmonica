    """
    Gravitational fields of right-rectangular prisms in Cartesian coordinates

    The gravitational fields are computed through the analytical solutions
    given by [Nagy2000]_ and [Nagy2002]_, which are valid on the entire domain.
    This means that the computation can be done at any point, either outside or
    inside the prism.

    This implementation makes use of the modified arctangent function proposed
    by [Fukushima2019]_ (eq. 12) so that the potential field to satisfies
    Poisson's equation in the entire domain. Moreover, the logarithm function
    was also modified in order to solve the singularities that the analytical
    solution has on some points (see [Nagy2000]_).

    .. warning::
        The **z direction points upwards**, i.e. positive and negative values
        of ``upward`` represent points above and below the surface,
        respectively. But remember that the ``g_z`` field returns the downward
        component of the gravitational acceleration so that positive density
        contrasts produce positive anomalies.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coordinates : list or 1d-array
        List or array containing ``easting``, ``northing`` and ``upward`` of
        the computation points defined on a Cartesian coordinate system.
        All coordinates should be in meters.
    prisms : list, 1d-array, or 2d-array
        List or array containing the coordinates of the prism(s) in the
        following order:
        west, east, south, north, bottom, top in a Cartesian coordinate system.
        All coordinates should be in meters. Coordinates for more than one
        prism can be provided. In this case, *prisms* should be a list of lists
        or 2d-array (with one prism per line).
    density : list or array
        List or array containing the density of each prism in kg/m^3.
    field : str
        Gravitational field that wants to be computed.
        The available fields are:

        - Gravitational potential: ``potential``
        - Downward acceleration: ``g_z``

    dtype : data-type (optional)
        Data type assigned to the resulting gravitational field. Default to
        ``np.float64``.
    disable_checks : bool (optional)
        Flag that controls whether to perform a sanity check on the model.
        Should be set to ``True`` only when it is certain that the input model
        is valid and it does not need to be checked.
        Default to ``False``.

    Returns
    -------
    result : array
        Gravitational field generated by the prisms on the computation points.

    Examples
