    Fetch a global grid of Earth gravity.

    Gravity is the magnitude of the gravity vector of the Earth (gravitational +
    centrifugal). The gravity observations are at 10 km (geometric) height and on a
    regular grid with 0.5 degree spacing. The grid was generated from the spherical
    harmonic model EIGEN-6C4 [Forste_etal2014]_ using the `ICGEM Calculation Service
    <http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de/>`__. See the ``attrs`` attribute of the
    :class:`xarray.Dataset` for information regarding the grid generation.

    Returns
    -------
    grid : :class:`xarray.Dataset`

        (``height_over_ell``). Coordinates are latitude and longitude.

    space and download times. The downsampled grid was generated from a spherical

    Brazil (CPRM) through their `GEOSGB portal <http://geosgb.cprm.gov.br/>`__.

    The columns of the data table are longitude, latitude, total-field magnetic anomaly
    (nanoTesla), observation height above the WGS84 ellipsoid (in meters), flight line
    type (LINE or TIE), and flight line number for each data point.
