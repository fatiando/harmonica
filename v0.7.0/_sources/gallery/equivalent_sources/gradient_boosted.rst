Gradient-boosted equivalent sources
===================================

When trying to grid a very large dataset, the regular
:class:`harmonica.EquivalentSources` might not be the best option: they will
require a lot of memory for storing the Jacobian matrices involved in the
fitting process of the source coefficients. Instead, we can make use of the
gradient-boosted equivalent sources, introduced in [Soler2021]_ and available
in Harmonica through the :class:`harmonica.EquivalentSourcesGB` class. The
gradient-boosted equivalent sources divide the survey region in overlapping
windows of equal size and fit the source coefficients iteratively, considering
the sources and data points that fall under each window at a time. The order in
which the windows are visited is randomized to improve convergence of the
algorithm.

Here we will produce a grid out of a portion of the ground gravity survey from
South Africa (see :func:`harmonica.datasets.fetch_south_africa_gravity`) using
the gradient-boosted equivalent sources. This particlar dataset is not very
large, in fact we could use the :class:`harmonica.EquivalentSources` instead.
But we will use the :class:`harmonica.EquivalentSourcesGB` for illustrating how
to use them on a small example.
