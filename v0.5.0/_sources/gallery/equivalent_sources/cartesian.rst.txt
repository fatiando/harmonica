Gridding and upward continuation
================================

Most potential field surveys gather data along scattered and uneven flight
lines or ground measurements. For a great number of applications we may need to
interpolate these data points onto a regular grid at a constant altitude.
Upward-continuation is also a routine task for smoothing, noise attenuation,
source separation, etc.

Both tasks can be done simultaneously through an *equivalent sources*
[Dampney1969]_ (a.k.a *equivalent layer*). We will use
:class:`harmonica.EquivalentSources` to estimate the coefficients of a set of
point sources that fit the observed data. The fitted sources can then be used
to predict data values wherever we want, like on a grid at a certain altitude.
By default, the sources for :class:`~harmonica.EquivalentSources` are placed
one beneath each data point at a relative depth from the elevation of the data
point following [Cooper2000]_. This behaviour can be changed throught the
`depth_type` optional argument.

The advantage of using equivalent sources is that it takes into account the 3D
nature of the observations, not just their horizontal positions. It also allows
data uncertainty to be taken into account and noise to be suppressed though the
least-squares fitting process. The main disadvantage is the increased
computational load (both in terms of time and memory).
