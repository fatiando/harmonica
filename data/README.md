# Sample data sets

These files are used as sample data in Harmonica:

* `gravity-earth-0.5deg.nc.xz`: Global gravity of the Earth at 0.5 degree grid spacing.
  The file contains the magnitude of the gradient of the gravity potential of the Earth
  (including the centrifugal component) on a regular grid of points at a constant
  geometric (ellipsoidal) height of 10 km. The grid was generated from the EIGEN-6C4
  gravity field model using the [ICGEM Calculation Service](http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de)
  and the WGS84 Reference System. The data are stored in a netCDF file and then `xz`
  compressed.
* `etopo1-0.5deg.nc.xz`: Global relief (topography and bathymetry) of the Earth based on
  the ETOPO1 model at 0.5 degree grid spacing. The grid was generated by the [ICGEM
  Calculation Service](http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de). The data are stored in a netCDF
  file and then `xz` compressed.
* `rio-magnetic.csv.xz`: Total-field magnetic anomaly data from the northwestern part of
  an airborne survey of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, conducted in 1978. Columns are
  longitude, latitude, total field anomaly (nanoTesla), observation height above the
  WGS84 ellipsoid (meters), type of flight line (LINE or TIE), and flight line number.
  The anomaly is calculated with respect to the IGRF field at the center of the survey
  area at 500 m altitude for the year 1978.3. This dataset was cropped from the original
  survey, made available by the Geological Survey of Brazil (CPRM) through their [GEOSGB
  portal](http://geosgb.cprm.gov.br/). See the original data for more processing
  information.
* `south-africa-gravity.ast.xz`:
  Land gravity survey performed in January 1986 within the boundaries of the Republic of
  South Africa. Columns are longitude, latitude, elevation (above sea level) and gravity
  (mGal). The observed gravity values are referenced to the International Gravity
  Standardization Net 1971 (IGSN 71). The data was made available by the [National
  Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/) (formerly
  NGDC) and are in the [public
  domain](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/ngdcinfo/privacy.html#copyright-notice). Original
  data files can be found at:
  https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/gravity/1999/data/regional/africa/ The data are stored
  in a netCDF file and then `xz` compressed.
