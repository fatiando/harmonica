# Sample data sets

These files are used as sample data in Harmonica:

* `gravity-earth-0.5deg.nc.xz`: Global gravity of the Earth at 0.5 degree grid spacing.
  The file contains the magnitude of the gradient of the gravity potential of the Earth
  (including the centrifugal component) on a regular grid of points at a constant
  geometric (ellipsoidal) height of 10 km. The grid was generated from the EIGEN-6C4
  gravity field model using the [ICGEM Calculation Service](http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de)
  and the WGS84 Reference System. The data are stored in a netCDF file and then `xz`
  compressed using Python's `lzma` library.
* `etopo1-0.5deg.nc.xz`: Global relief (topography and bathymetry) of the Earth based on
  the ETOPO1 model at 0.5 degree grid spacing. The original heights referenced to the
  sea level were converted to geometric (ellipsoidal) heights using a geoid grid derived
  from the EIGEN-6C4 gravity field model. Both grids were generated by the
  [ICGEM Calculation Service](http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de). The data are stored in a
  netCDF file and then `xz` compressed using Python's `lzma` library.
