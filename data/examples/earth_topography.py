Earth Topography
================

The topography and bathymetry of the Earth according to the ETOPO1 model
[AmanteEakins2009]_. The original model has 1 arc-minute grid spacing but here
we downsampled to 0.5 degree grid spacing to save space and download times.
Heights are referenced to sea level.
