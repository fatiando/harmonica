Earth Geoid
===========

The geoid is the equipotential surface of the Earth's gravity potential that
coincides with mean sea level. It's often represented by "geoid heights", which
indicate the height of the geoid relative to the reference ellipsoid (WGS84 in
this case). Negative values indicate that the geoid is below the ellipsoid
surface and positive values that it is above. The data are on a regular grid
with 0.5 degree spacing and was generated from the spherical harmonic model
EIGEN-6C4 [Forste_etal2014]_.
