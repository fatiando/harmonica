Installing
==========

Which Python?
-------------

You'll need **Python 3.6 or greater**.

We recommend using the
`Anaconda Python distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`__
to ensure you have all dependencies installed and the ``conda`` package manager
available.
Installing Anaconda does not require administrative rights to your computer and
doesn't interfere with any other Python installations in your system.


Dependencies
------------

* `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`__
* `scipy <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/>`__
* `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__
* `xarray <https://xarray.pydata.org/>`__
* `attrs <https://www.attrs.org/>`__
* `pooch <http://www.fatiando.org/pooch/>`__
* `verde <http://www.fatiando.org/verde/>`__

Most of the examples in the :ref:`gallery` also use:

* `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__
* `cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/>`__ for plotting maps


Installing the latest development version
-----------------------------------------

You can use ``pip`` to install the latest source from Github::

    pip install https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/archive/master.zip

Alternatively, you can clone the git repository locally and install from there::

    git clone https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica.git
    cd harmonica
    pip install .


Testing your install
--------------------

We ship a full test suite with the package.
To run the tests, you'll need to install some extra dependencies first:

* `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/>`__

After that, you can test your installation by running the following inside a Python
interpreter::

    import harmonica
    harmonica.test()
