Magnetic dipoles
================

We can compute the magnetic field generated by dipole sources through
the :func:`harmonica.dipole_magnetic` function.

Each dipole can be defined as a tuple containing its coordinates in the
following order: *easting*, *northing*, *upward* (in Cartesian coordinates and
in meters).

.. jupyter-execute::
   :hide-code:

   import harmonica as hm

Let's define a single dipole and compute the magnetic field it generates on
a computation point above it.

Define the dipole and its magnetic moment vector:

.. jupyter-execute::

   dipole = (20, 40, -50)
   magnetic_moment = (100, 100, 100)

Define the observation point above it:

.. jupyter-execute::

   coordinates = (20, 40, 10)

And compute the three components of the magnetic field the dipole generates by
choosing ``field="b"``:

.. jupyter-execute::

   b_e, b_n, b_u = hm.dipole_magnetic(coordinates, dipole, magnetic_moment, field="b")
   print(b_e, b_n, b_u)

We can compute just a single component with ``field`` set to ``"b_e"``,
``"b_n"`` or ``"b_u"``:

.. jupyter-execute::

   b_u = hm.dipole_magnetic(
      coordinates, dipole, magnetic_moment, field="b_u"
   )
   print(b_u)


Multiple dipoles
----------------

We can also use this function to compute the magnetic fields of multiple
dipoles on multiple observation points.

Let's define a regular grid of observation points:

.. jupyter-execute::

   import verde as vd

   region = (-100, 100, -100, 100)
   spacing = 1
   height = 0
   coordinates = vd.grid_coordinates(
      region=region, spacing=spacing, extra_coords=height
   )

And a set of dipoles with their magnetic moments:

.. jupyter-execute::

   import numpy as np

   easting = [25, 35, -30, -50]
   northing = [3, -38, 22, -30]
   upward = [-200, -100, -300, -150]
   dipoles = (easting, northing, upward)

   mag_e = [1e3, 2e3, 500, 2e3]
   mag_n = [1e3, 2e3, 500, 2e3]
   mag_u = [1e3, 2e3, 500, 2e3]
   magnetic_moments = (mag_e, mag_n, mag_u)

Now, let's compute the magnetic field components that the dipoles generate on
every observation point:

.. jupyter-execute::

   b_e, b_n, b_u = hm.dipole_magnetic(coordinates, dipoles, magnetic_moments, field="b")

.. jupyter-execute::

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=3, sharey=True, figsize=(12, 8))

   fields = {"b_e": b_e, "b_n": b_n, "b_u": b_u}
   for field, ax in zip(fields, axes):
      tmp = ax.pcolormesh(coordinates[0], coordinates[1], fields[field])
      ax.set_aspect("equal")
      ax.set_title(field)
      ax.ticklabel_format(style="sci", scilimits=(0, 0), axis="both")
      plt.colorbar(tmp, ax=ax, orientation="horizontal", label="nT", pad=0.008)
   plt.show()
