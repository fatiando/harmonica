Point sources
=============

We can compute the gravitational field of point masses through the
:func:`harmonica.point_gravity` function.
It offers the possibility to define point sources and computation points either
in Cartesian or in spherical coordinates.

Each point mass can be defined as a tuple containing its coordinates in the
following order: *easting*, *northing* and *upward* (in Cartesian coordinates)
or *longitude*, *spherical latitude* and *radius* (in spherical coordinates).

Cartesian coordinates
---------------------

.. jupyter-execute::
   :hide-code:

   import harmonica as hm

For example, lets define a single point mass and compute the gravitational
potential it generates on a computation point located 100 meters above it.

Define the point source and its mass (in kg):

.. jupyter-execute::

   point = (400, 300, 200)
   mass = 1e6

Define a computation point located 100m above the point source:

.. jupyter-execute::

   coordinates = (point[0], point[1], point[2] + 100)

And finally, compute the gravitational potential field it generates on the
computation point:

.. jupyter-execute::

   potential = hm.point_gravity(coordinates, point, mass, field="potential")
   print(potential, "J/kg")


Working with multiple sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can easily compute the gravitational field of a set of point sources by
grouping its coordinates in arrays and with a single call of the
:func:`harmonica.point_gravity`.

Lets define a set of four point sources, along with their masses:

.. jupyter-execute::

   import numpy as np

   easting = np.array([250, 750, 250, 750])
   northing = np.array([250, 250, 750, 750])
   upward = np.array([-100, -100, -100, -100])
   points = (easting, northing, upward)

   masses = np.array([1e6, -1e6, 2e6, -3e6])

We can define a set of computation points located on a regular grid at zero
height:

.. jupyter-execute::

   import verde as vd

   coordinates = vd.grid_coordinates(
       region=(-250, 1250, -250, 1250), shape=(40, 40), extra_coords=0
   )

And finally calculate the vertical component of the gravitational acceleration
generated by the whole set of point sources on every computation point:

.. jupyter-execute::

   g_z = hm.point_gravity(coordinates, points, masses, field="g_z")

.. note::

   When passing multiple sources and coordinates to
   :func:`harmonica.point_gravity` we calculate the field in parallel using
   multiple CPUs, speeding up the computation.

Lets plot this gravitational field:

.. jupyter-execute::

   import pygmt

   grid = vd.make_xarray_grid(
      coordinates, g_z, data_names="g_z", extra_coords_names="extra")

   fig = pygmt.Figure()

   maxabs = vd.maxabs(g_z)
   pygmt.makecpt(cmap="polar", series=(-maxabs, maxabs), background=True)

   fig.grdimage(
      region=(-250, 1250, -250, 1250),
      projection="X10c",
      grid=grid.g_z,
      frame=["a", "x+leasting (m)", "y+lnorthing (m)"],
      cmap=True,)
   fig.colorbar(cmap=True, position="JMR", frame=["a.0005", "x+lmGal"])
   fig.show()



Spherical coordinates
---------------------

Alternatively, we can compute the gravitational fields of point sources defined
in a spherical coordinate system. To do so, we need to pass the
``coordinate_system`` argument as ``"spherical"```. The coordinates of the
point source must now be passed as *longitude*, *spherical latitude* and
*radius*, where the two former ones must be in decimal degrees and the latter
in meters.

Lets define a single point source in the equator, at a longitude of 45 degrees
and located on the surface of the WGS84 ellipsoid.

We can start by obtaining the WGS84 ellipsoid from :mod:`boule`:

.. jupyter-execute::

   import boule as bl

   ellipsoid = bl.WGS84


Then we can define the point source in the equator along with its mass:

.. jupyter-execute::

   longitude, latitude = 45, 0
   radius = ellipsoid.geocentric_radius(latitude, geodetic=False)
   point = (longitude, latitude, radius)

   mass = 1e6

We can also define a computation point located 1km above the point source:

.. jupyter-execute::

   coordinates = (point[0], point[1], point[2] + 1000)

And finally compute the gravitational field generated by the source on the
computation point:

.. jupyter-execute::

   g_z = hm.point_gravity(
       coordinates, point, mass, field="g_z", coordinate_system="spherical"
   )
   print(g_z, "mGal")


Working with sources defined in geodetic coordinates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If our point sources and computation points are defined in geodetic
coordinates, we can use the :meth:`boule.Ellipsoid.geodetic_to_spherical`
method to convert them to spherical coordinates and use them to compute their
gravitational field.

Lets define a set point sources in geodetic coordinates and their masses:

.. jupyter-execute::

   longitude = np.array([-71, -71, -69, -69])
   latitude = np.array([-45, -43, -45, -43])
   height = np.array([-10e3, -20e3, -30e3, -20e3])
   points = (longitude, latitude, height)

   masses = np.array([1e6, 2e6, -3e6, 5e6])


Then, build a regular grid of computation points defined in geodetic
coordinates and located at 1km above the ellipsoid:

.. jupyter-execute::

   coordinates = vd.grid_coordinates(
       region=(-72, -68, -46, -42),
       shape=(101, 101),
       extra_coords=20e3,
   )

Before we can start forward modelling these sources, we need to convert them to
spherical coordinates. To do so, we can use the
:meth:`boule.Ellipsoid.geodetic_to_spherical` method:

.. jupyter-execute::

   points_spherical = ellipsoid.geodetic_to_spherical(*points)
   coordinates_spherical = ellipsoid.geodetic_to_spherical(*coordinates)

We can finally use these converted coordinates to compute the gravitational
field the source generate on every computation point:

.. jupyter-execute::

   g_z = hm.point_gravity(
       coordinates_spherical,
       points_spherical,
       masses,
       field="g_z",
       coordinate_system="spherical",
   )

Lets plot these results using :mod:`pygmt`:

.. jupyter-execute::

   import pygmt

   grid = vd.make_xarray_grid(
      coordinates_spherical, g_z, data_names="g_z", extra_coords_names="extra")

   fig = pygmt.Figure()
   title = "Gravitational acceleration (downward)"
   maxabs = vd.maxabs(g_z)*.95
   pygmt.makecpt(cmap="polar", series=(-maxabs, maxabs), background=True)

   fig.grdimage(
      region=(-72, -68, -46, -42),
      projection="M10c",
      grid=grid.g_z,
      frame=[f"WSne+t{title}", "x", "y"],
      cmap=True,)

   fig.colorbar(cmap=True, position="JMR", frame=["a0.000000005", "x+lmGal"])
   fig.show()
