Harmonica offers some functions and classes to calculate the gravity and
magnetic fields generated by the following 3D bodies.

General description
-------------------

Most of these functions require three main arguments:

- The **computation points**, which are usually passed as the ``coordinates``
  argument. These are the set of points where the field will be computed. They
  must be a tuple containing its coordinates in the following order:
  ``easting``, ``northing`` and ``upward`` or ``longitude``, ``latitude`` and
  ``radius`` (depending on the coordinate system that's being used).
- The **sources** or **geometric bodies** that generate the field that will be
  computed. They must be often specified by their location or their boundaries.
- The **physical properties** of the sources. For example, when computing
  gravity fields we might need to pass either the *density* or the *mass* of
  the sources.

Optionally, we might need to specify which type of *field* we want to compute.
For example, we might choose the *potential* gravity field or the vertical
component of the gravity acceleration (``"g_z"``).
