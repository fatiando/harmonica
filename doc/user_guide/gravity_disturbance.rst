Gravity Disturbances
====================

Gravity disturbances (:math:`\delta g(\mathbf{p})`) are the differences between
the measured gravity (:math:`g(\mathbf{p})`) and a reference (normal) gravity
produced by an ellipsoid (:math:`\gamma(\mathbf{p})`):

.. math::

   \delta g(\mathbf{p}) = g(\mathbf{p}) - \gamma(\mathbf{p})

Where :math:`\mathbf{p}` is the observation point where the gravity
measurement has been carried out.
The disturbances are what allows geoscientists to infer the internal structure
of the Earth.

We can compute the normal gravity generated by any ellipsoid through the
:meth:`boule.Ellipsoid.normal_gravity` method from :mod:`boule` and use it to
compute gravity disturbances.
