Fist release of Harmonica. Forward modeling, inversion, and processing gravity
and magnetic data.

Forward models:

- Point masses in Cartesian coordinates. Gravitational potential with vertical
  (`#71 <https://github.com/fatiando/PROJECT/pull/71>`__) and horizontal
  components of acceleration
  (`#119 <https://github.com/fatiando/PROJECT/pull/119>`__).
- Point masses in spherical coordinates.
  (`#60 <https://github.com/fatiando/PROJECT/pull/60>`__)
- Rectangular prisms. (`#86 <https://github.com/fatiando/PROJECT/pull/86>`__)
- Tesseroids. (`#60 <https://github.com/fatiando/PROJECT/pull/60>`__)
