Gridding with block-averaged equivalent sources
===============================================

By default, the :class:`harmonica.EquivalentSources` class locates one point
source beneath each data point during the fitting process. Alternatively, we
can use another strategy: the *block-averaged sources*, introduced in
[Soler2021]_.

This method divides the survey region (defined by the data) into square blocks
of equal size, computes the median coordinates of the data points that fall
inside each block and locates one source beneath every averaged position. This
way, we define one equivalent source per block, with the exception of empty
blocks that won't get any source.

This method has two main benefits:

- It lowers the amount of sources involved in the interpolation, therefore it
  reduces the computer memory requirements and the computation time of the
  fitting and prediction processes.
- It might avoid to produce aliasing on the output grids, specially for
  surveys with oversampling along a particular direction, like airborne ones.

We can make use of the block-averaged sources within the
:class:`harmonica.EquivalentSources` class by passing a value to the
``block_size`` parameter, which controls the size of the blocks. We recommend
using a ``block_size`` not larger than the desired resolution of the
interpolation grid.

The depth of the sources can be set analogously to the regular equivalent
sources: we can use a ``constant`` depth (every source is located at the same
depth) or a ``relative`` depth (where each source is located at a constant
shift beneath the median location obtained during the block-averaging process).
The depth of the sources and which strategy to use can be set up through the
``depth`` and the ``depth_type`` parameters, respectively.
