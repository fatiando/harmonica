Gravity Disturbances
====================

Gravity disturbances are the differences between the measured gravity and
a reference (normal) gravity produced by an ellipsoid. The disturbances are
what allows geoscientists to infer the internal structure of the Earth. We'll
use the :meth:`boule.Ellipsoid.normal_gravity` function from :mod:`boule` to
calculate the global gravity disturbance of the Earth using our sample gravity
data.
