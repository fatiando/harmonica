"""
Topography-free (Bouguer) Gravity Disturbances
==============================================

The gravity disturbance is the observed gravity minus the normal gravity
(:func:`harmonica.normal_gravity`). The signal that is left is assumed to be due to the
differences between the actual Earth and the reference ellipsoid. Big components in
this signal are the effects of topographic masses outside of the ellipsoid and
residual effects of the oceans (we removed ellipsoid crust where there was actually
ocean water). These two components are relatively well known and can be removed from the
gravity disturbance. The simplest way of calculating the effects of topography and
oceans is through the Bouguer plate approximation.

We'll use :func:`harmonica.bouguer_correction` to calculate a topography-free gravity
disturbance for Earth using our sample gravity and topography data. One thing to note is
that the ETOPO1 topography is referenced to the geoid, not the ellipsoid. Since we want
to remove the masses between the surface of the Earth and ellipsoid, we need to add the
geoid height to the topography before Bouguer correction.
