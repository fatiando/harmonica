Gravitational effect of topography
==================================

One possible application of the :func:`harmonica.prisms_layer` function is to
create a model of the terrain and compute its gravity effect. Here we will use
a regular grid of topographic and bathymetric heights for South Africa to
create a prisms layer that model the terrain with a density of 2670 kg/m^3 and
the ocean with a density contrast of -1900 kg/m^3 obtained as the difference
between the density of water (1000 kg/m^3) and the normal density of upper
crust (2900 kg/m^3). Then we will use :func:`harmonica.prism_gravity` to
compute the gravity effect of the model on a regular grid of observation
points.
